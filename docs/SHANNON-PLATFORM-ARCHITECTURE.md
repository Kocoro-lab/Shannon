Note (Production Enhancements):
- User-in-the-loop approvals are completed via an admin HTTP endpoint on the orchestrator (`POST /approvals/decision`), signaling Temporal workflows on channel `human-approval-<ApprovalID>`.
- Single-result bypass is enabled to skip synthesis when one agent succeeds, reducing latency and cost deterministically.
- LLM-powered synthesis is the default for multi-agent paths, with fallback to simple concatenation on errors.
- Context compression for long histories (`context_compress_v1`) summarizes recent conversation via `POST /context/compress`; summaries are stored in Qdrant under a dedicated `vector.summaries` collection and injected into agent context as `history_summary`.
```

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns

Each layer has distinct responsibilities with clear interfaces between components. This enables independent scaling, testing, and evolution of each subsystem.

### 2. Token-First Performance Design

Based on Anthropic's findings that token usage is the primary performance driver, our architecture treats token management as a first-class concern with dedicated budget controllers and optimization strategies.

### 3. Exploratory Understanding Over Static Retrieval

Instead of passive RAG-based retrieval, agents employ active exploration through hypothesis generation, evidence gathering, and iterative refinement—reducing token usage by 40-60% while improving accuracy.

### 4. Context Engineering as System Design

Context is treated as a multi-component system rather than simple prompts, incorporating:

- Structured system instructions
- Dynamic external knowledge injection
- Tool definitions and capabilities
- Persistent and working memory
- State information management

### 5. Stateless Agent Design  

Agents are stateless between invocations, with all state externalized to storage systems. This enables horizontal scaling and simplifies recovery from failures.

### 6. Event-Driven Communication

Asynchronous messaging via NATS JetStream for control plane with replay capability, and Kinesis as downstream analytics sink. This provides reliable message delivery with event replay for debugging while keeping analytics separate.

### 7. Economic Incentive Alignment

Web3 integration creates economic incentives for quality work through proof-of-execution attestation recording (with optional on-chain anchoring) and reputation systems.

### 8. Zero-Trust Security Architecture

Every input is treated as potentially hostile, with multiple layers of validation, sanitization, and isolation to prevent context injection, memory poisoning, and tool abuse attacks.

## System Components

### 1. Agent Core (Rust)

#### Enforcement Gateway

Rust acts as a strict execution gateway in front of Python tools. It does not orchestrate with an in‑process FSM. Instead it enforces request‑level policies for every call:

- Per‑request timeouts
- Rate limiting (per user/workflow key)
- Circuit breaker (rolling error rate)
- Token ceiling checks (estimated)

Requests then route to Python (LLM/tools) or WASI (untrusted code) with consistent enforcement and metrics. Orchestration and workflow‑level budgets live in Temporal (Go).

#### Runtime Memory Management

The Rust layer manages **runtime memory (RAM)**, not database persistence:

- **Memory Pool**: Allocates and tracks RAM for agent tasks
- **Resource Limits**: Enforces memory caps per agent
- **Garbage Collection**: Reclaims unused memory
- **Note**: Database operations are handled by Go/Python layers

#### Belief State Management

Sophisticated state tracking for exploratory understanding:

- **Hypothesis Management**: Multiple competing hypotheses with confidence scores (0-1)
- **Evidence Accumulation**: Raw evidence fragments with hypothesis correlations
- **Information Gain Calculation**: Prioritizes explorations that maximize uncertainty reduction
- **Contradiction Detection**: Identifies and resolves conflicting evidence

#### User Preference & Personalization System

- **Preference Storage Options**:
  - User markdown files (CLAUDE.md style) for declarative preferences
  - Semantic/Q-learning for continuous learning / or LoRA adapter management for personalized model behavior
  - Per-user context templates and behavioral patterns
  - Preference versioning and rollback capabilities
- **Personalization Engine**:
  - Dynamic preference injection into agent context
  - Semantic/Q-learning for continuous learning / or LoRA adapter hot-swapping based on user/task
  - User-specific hypothesis generation biases
  - Customized tool selection and prioritization
- **Privacy & Isolation**:
  - Strict user data isolation
  - Encrypted preference storage
  - GDPR-compliant data handling

#### WASM Sandbox

Provides isolated execution environment for untrusted code with configurable resource limits (memory, CPU, network access). Uses wasmtime with WASI for standardized system interface.

#### Security & Isolation Layer

- **Context Injection Prevention**:
  - Input validation and sanitization for all data sources
  - PDF/file upload scanning for hidden prompts
  - API response validation against schemas
  - Database query result sanitization
  - Tool output verification and filtering
- **Memory Poisoning Protection**:
  - Append-only Merkle log of memory entries (tamper-evident)
  - Immutable audit trail for memory modifications
  - Periodic integrity checks with batch on-chain anchoring (optional)
  - Rollback mechanisms for corrupted memories
  - Isolated memory stores per security context
- **Context Pipeline Isolation**:
  - Separate pipelines for user data, system instructions, external data
  - Cross-pipeline communication only through validated channels
  - Sandboxed execution environments per pipeline
  - Context mixing prevention mechanisms

#### Policy Enforcement  

OPA-based policy engine evaluates agent actions against tenant-specific rules, ensuring compliance with security, budget, and operational constraints.

#### Token Budget Management

Pre-execution budget verification and post-execution charging with support for different budget types (per-task, daily, monthly). Integrates with blockchain for transparent accounting.

### 2. Orchestration Layer (Go)

#### DAG Engine

Executes directed acyclic graphs of agent tasks with:

- Topological sorting for dependency resolution
- Parallel execution of independent nodes
- Idempotency management for retry safety
- State checkpointing for recovery
- May integrate with Temporal.io core

#### Session Management System

- **Session State Tracking**:
  - Unique session ID generation and management
  - Context continuity verification across interactions
  - Resume points for interrupted sessions
  - Session metadata (duration, tokens used, outcomes)
- **Cross-Session Context Transfer**:
  - Automatic session handoff protocols
  - Context summarization at session boundaries
  - Relevance filtering for new sessions
  - User confirmation for context carry-over
- **Long-term User Tracking**:
  - User interaction history aggregation
  - Preference evolution tracking over time
  - Task pattern recognition and prediction
  - Personalized knowledge base building

#### Task Decomposition Strategy with Simplicity-First Modes

**Execution Mode Selection (Claude Code Inspired)**:

```python
class ExecutionModeSelector:
    def select_mode(self, task):
        complexity = self.estimate_complexity(task)
        
        if complexity <= 3:
            return "simple"   # No orchestration needed
        elif complexity <= 7:
            return "standard" # Light orchestration
        else:
            return "complex"  # Full orchestration
```

**Mode Definitions**:

- **Simple Mode** (30% of tasks):
  - Direct execution without orchestration overhead
  - Single agent or direct tool calls
  - 1-5 tool calls maximum
  - Uses smallest model (Haiku)
  - No state management needed

- **Standard Mode** (50% of tasks):
  - Light orchestration with 1-3 agents
  - 10-20 tool calls
  - Minimal state checkpointing
  - Mix of Haiku/Sonnet models

- **Complex Mode** (20% of tasks):
  - Full orchestration with up to 5 parallel agents
  - Unlimited tool calls with budget constraints
  - Complete state management and checkpointing
  - Opus for critical reasoning, Sonnet for execution

**Anthropic's proven patterns (Complex Mode)**:

- Simple queries: 1 agent, 3-10 tool calls
- Comparisons: 2-4 agents, 10-15 calls each  
- Complex research: 5-10 agents with clear boundaries
- Hard limit of 5 parallel agents for optimal performance

#### Worker Pool Management

Dynamic worker allocation with:

- Load-based routing
- Tenant isolation
- Graceful degradation under load
- Circuit breakers for failing services

#### Event Streaming Integration

**NATS JetStream** for all control plane messaging:

- Persistent message queues with replay

## Agent Architecture Patterns

### Agent Loop Design

The core agent loop implements Exploratory Understanding, an evolution beyond traditional ReAct patterns:

#### Traditional ReAct Pattern

1. **Perceive**: Gather context and observations
2. **Think**: Reason about next actions
3. **Act**: Execute tools or spawn subagents
4. **Observe**: Process results

#### Enhanced Exploratory Understanding Loop

1. **Generate Hypotheses**: Create 3-5 competing theories about the problem space
2. **Select Hypothesis**: Choose the one with maximum information gain potential
3. **Formulate Queries**: Generate targeted searches based on hypothesis
4. **Execute Tools**: Gather evidence through focused exploration
5. **Update Belief State**: Adjust confidence scores based on evidence
6. **Self-Reflection**: Analyze supporting/contradicting evidence
7. **Synthesize or Iterate**: Either form conclusion or generate new hypotheses
8. **Termination Check**: Stop when confidence >0.85 and contradictions <0.1

#### Case-Based Reasoning Loop

1. **Case Retrieval**: Query similar past cases from Case Memory
   - Semantic similarity search (non-parametric)
   - Q-function ranking (parametric, learned online)
2. **Case Adaptation**: Modify retrieved plan for current context
3. **Plan Decomposition**: Break into subtasks using adapted case
4. **Tool Execution**: Execute subtasks with tool result caching
5. **Memory Update**: 
   - Write (state, action, reward) to Case Memory
   - Update Q-function weights based on outcome
   - Cache tool results for future reuse
6. **Continuous Learning**: No LLM fine-tuning, only Q-network updates

### Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

#### Orchestrator-Worker Pattern with Exploratory Understanding

- Lead agent generates competing hypotheses about the query
- Spawns specialized subagents, each testing different hypotheses in parallel
- Subagents use focused exploration rather than broad retrieval
- Evidence aggregation updates global belief state
- Synthesis based on highest-confidence hypothesis chain
- Manages token budgets with 40-60% reduction through focused exploration
- **Communication Protocols**: gRPC/Protobuf schemas for inter-agent messaging (versioned, backward-compatible)
- **Proven Frameworks**: Leverages patterns from AutoGen, MetaGPT, CAMEL

#### Hierarchical Organization

- Manager agents delegate to specialist agents
- Clear task boundaries prevent duplicate work
- Structured communication protocols
- Progressive result aggregation

#### Consensus Mechanisms

- Multiple agents vote on decisions
- Weighted voting based on expertise/reputation
- Deliberation protocols for disagreements
- Blockchain-recorded consensus results

### Memory Management Strategies

### Caching Strategies

#### Prompt Caching Discipline (2025 Best Practice)

**KV Cache Optimization**:

```python
class PromptCacheManager:
    """Maximize prompt caching with 1-hour TTL"""
    
    def optimize_for_caching(self, context):
        # Keep stable prefixes for cache hits
        stable_prefix = {
            "system": self.get_immutable_instructions(),
            "user_prefs": self.get_static_preferences(),
            "tools": self.get_tool_definitions()
        }
        
        # Make traces append-only for cache efficiency
        append_only = {
            "conversation": self.format_as_append_only(),
            "evidence": self.add_incrementally()
        }
        
        # Mark cache breakpoints deliberately
        cache_segments = self.segment_for_optimal_caching(
            stable_prefix, 
            append_only,
            breakpoint_size=50_000  # Optimal chunk size
        )
        
        return cache_segments
```

**Cache-Aware Context Hygiene**:

- Maintain stable prefixes across requests
- Use deterministic ordering for tool definitions

4. **Semantic Cache**: Embedding-based similarity
5. **Hypothesis Cache**: Validated hypothesis-evidence chains
6. **Exploration Pattern Cache**: Successful search strategies by problem type
7. **Context Template Cache**: Pre-optimized context structures for common tasks
8. **User Preference Cache**: Hot user configurations and LoRA references
9. **Session Summary Cache**: Recent conversation summaries for context

        # Always try cheapest model first
        if self.can_use_small_model(task):
            return provider_config.tier_1.select_optimal()  # 50% of calls
        
        # Complexity assessment
        complexity_score = self.assess_complexity(task)
        
        if complexity_score < 3:
            return provider_config.tier_1.select()  # Simple tasks
        elif complexity_score < 7:
            return provider_config.tier_2.select()  # Standard tasks
        elif context.budget_remaining < threshold:
            return provider_config.tier_2.select_cheapest()
        elif task.requires_reasoning():
            # Use specialized reasoning models (QwQ, DeepSeek-R1)
            return provider_config.get_reasoning_specialist()
        else:
            return provider_config.tier_3.select()  # Complex tasks only

## Production Readiness

### Testing Strategies

#### Deterministic Testing

- Mock LLM responses for unit tests
- Recorded tool interactions
- Predictable random seeds
- Snapshot testing for outputs

#### Temporal deterministic replay

- Purpose: verify workflow determinism by replaying recorded event histories against current workflow code (no activities re-executed).
- Local export:
  - Uses the modern Temporal CLI (migrated from deprecated tctl) to export history as clean JSON.
  - Example:

```bash
# Export history (latest run) to a file
make replay-export WORKFLOW_ID=<id> OUT=history.json

# Or include a specific run id
make replay-export WORKFLOW_ID=<id> RUN_ID=<run> OUT=history.json
```

- Local replay:

```bash
# Run deterministic replay against current orchestrator workflows
make replay HISTORY=history.json

# One-shot: export + replay
./scripts/replay_workflow.sh <workflow_id> [run_id]
```

- CI gate (optional): place histories under `tests/histories/*.json` and run:

```bash
make ci-replay
```

- Notes:
  - Replay validates workflow code compatibility; any non-determinism fails the run.
  - Activities are not re-executed; their results come from history. Use this for audit/regression, not for re-evaluating LLM/tool behavior.
  - CI: our GitHub Actions pipeline runs `make ci-replay` automatically if any histories are present under `tests/histories/`.

#### Integration Testing

- End-to-end workflow validation
- Multi-agent coordination tests

        regressions = []
        for metric, baseline_value in baseline.items():
            if current[metric] < baseline_value * 0.95:  # 5% tolerance
                regressions.append({
                    "metric": metric,
                    "baseline": baseline_value,
                    "current": current[metric],
                    "degradation": (baseline_value - current[metric]) / baseline_value
                })
        
        if regressions:
            raise RegressionError(f"Performance regressions detected: {regressions}")
        
        return True
```

The convergence of these empirically validated approaches—Anthropic's token insights, Exploratory Understanding's efficiency gains, and Context Engineering's performance multipliers—creates a platform that achieves superior results at a fraction of traditional costs. The Web3 layer ensures these gains are captured, measured, and rewarded transparently.

### Security-First Design Philosophy

This architecture implements a comprehensive zero-trust security model that addresses the three critical vulnerabilities in AI agent systems:

1. **Context Injection Prevention**: Every input source is validated, sanitized, and isolated
