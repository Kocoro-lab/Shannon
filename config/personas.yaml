# Shannon Persona Definitions
# ⚠️  WARNING: THIS FILE IS NOT CURRENTLY LOADED OR USED BY SHANNON
#
# Current Status:
# - This persona system is planned but NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
# - The Python LLM service does not load this file
# - Only role presets in python/llm-service/llm_service/roles/presets.py are active
# - See go/orchestrator/internal/activities/agent.go:453-506 for implementation notes
#
# What Works Now:
# - Use context["role"] to select from: generalist, analysis, research, writer, critic
# - Use context["system_prompt"] to completely override the system prompt
# - See docs/system-prompts.md for full documentation
#
# Known Issues:
# - Tool names below (grep, read, glob, code_executor, edit, write, bash, etc.)
#   do NOT match actual tool registry names
# - Actual tools: calculator, web_search, python_wasi_executor, file_ops, session_file
# - Tool names must be mapped when this config is wired up
#
# Future Implementation:
# - These personas will be automatically assigned to subtasks based on task content
# - Will support keyword matching, LLM selection, and semantic matching
# - Will enable tool allowlists per persona and richer prompt templates
# - Tool name mapping required before activation
