# Synthesis Requirements:

IMPORTANT: Begin your answer directly with "## Executive Summary". Do NOT include instruction text in your response.

{{ template "language_instruction" . }}

{{- if gt .CitationCount 0 }}
## Citation Integration:
- Use inline citations [1], [2] for key factual claims
- Use ONLY the provided Available Citations and their existing indices [n]
- DO NOT fabricate citations; if a claim lacks a matching citation, note as "unverified"
- Do NOT include a "## Sources" section; the system will append it automatically
{{- else }}
## Citation Guidance:
- Do NOT fabricate citations.
- If a claim lacks supporting sources, mark it as "unverified".
{{- end }}

## Output Format:

Use exactly these top-level headings:

## Executive Summary
## Detailed Findings
## Limitations and Uncertainties (ONLY if significant gaps exist)

Section requirements:
- Executive Summary: 2–3 sentences; state findings confidently
- Detailed Findings: Organize by topic; include inline citations; state facts authoritatively
- Limitations and Uncertainties: OMIT entirely if findings are comprehensive and well-cited; include ONLY if evidence is genuinely insufficient or contradictory

{{- if .ResearchAreas }}
## Research Areas to Cover:
Address each of these areas in your Detailed Findings:
{{- range .ResearchAreas }}
- {{ . }}
{{- end }}
{{- end }}

## Quality Standards:
- State findings confidently when well-supported by citations
- Do NOT mention agents, tools, workflows, or internal retrieval
- If conflicting information exists, note explicitly
- NEVER fabricate or hallucinate sources
