# Synthesis Requirements:

IMPORTANT: Do NOT include any of the Synthesis Requirements, Output Format, or Coverage Checklist text in the final answer. The final answer must contain ONLY the report sections, their content, AND the structured facts appendix.

## Coverage Checklist (DO NOT STOP until ALL are satisfied):
{{- if .ResearchAreas }}
✓ Each of the {{ len .ResearchAreas }} research areas has a dedicated subsection (### heading)
✓ Each subsection contains 150–250 words minimum
{{- end }}
✓ Executive Summary captures key insights (150–250 words)
{{ template "coverage_checklist_citations" . }}
✓ Response written in the SAME language as the query
✓ Structured Facts appendix contains all key factual claims

{{ template "language_instruction" . }}

## Preserve Source Integrity:
- Keep findings VERBATIM when referencing specific data/quotes
- Synthesize patterns across sources, but don't paraphrase individual claims

## Structured Content Preservation:
- Named entities (names, titles, credentials) MUST be preserved verbatim - do NOT compress into generic terms
- Lists of 3+ items with attributes → CREATE markdown tables
- Quantitative data MUST be specific (numbers, not vague descriptors like "several" or "significant")
- Material conflicts (>20% numerical difference): State both versions with attribution

## Quantitative Synthesis Requirements:
- When data/numbers/metrics are available in agent results: CREATE MARKDOWN TABLES when appropriate
- Tables should compare: size, growth rates, market share, performance metrics, costs, timelines
{{- if not .CitationAgentEnabled }}
- Include inline citations [n] for ALL data points in tables
{{- end }}

## Output Format:

Use exactly these top-level headings in your response:

## Executive Summary
## Detailed Findings
## Limitations and Uncertainties (ONLY if significant gaps/conflicts exist)
## Structured Facts

Section requirements:
- Executive Summary: 150–250 words; capture key insights and conclusions
- Detailed Findings: {{ .TargetWords }}–{{ add .TargetWords 600 }} words total; organize by research areas
- Limitations and Uncertainties: 100–150 words IF evidence is incomplete; OMIT if well-supported
- Structured Facts: JSON array of extracted facts (see format below)

{{- if .ResearchAreas }}
## MANDATORY Research Area Coverage:
You MUST create a subsection for EACH of the {{ len .ResearchAreas }} research areas below.
{{- range .ResearchAreas }}
### {{ . }}
{{- end }}
{{- end }}

## Structured Facts Appendix Format:

After the main report, include a "## Structured Facts" section with a JSON code block:

```json
{
  "facts": [
    {
      "id": "fact-1",
      "statement": "Factual claim extracted from synthesis",
      "category": "funding|product|market|technical|team|partnership|regulatory|performance",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "source_citations": [1, 3],
      "entities": ["Company X", "Product Y"],
      "temporal": "2024-Q2",
      "quantitative": true
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total_facts": 15,
    "high_confidence": 12,
    "categories": {"funding": 3, "product": 5, "market": 4, "technical": 3}
  }
}
```

### Fact Extraction Guidelines:
- Extract 10-20 discrete, verifiable factual claims from the synthesis
- Each fact should be a single, atomic statement
- Assign confidence based on evidence quality: 0.9+ for multiple sources, 0.7-0.9 for single source
{{- if not .CitationAgentEnabled }}
- Include citation indices that support each fact
{{- end }}
- Categories: funding, product, market, technical, team, partnership, regulatory, performance
- Mark quantitative facts (those with numbers, metrics, percentages) as quantitative: true
- Include temporal markers when dates/periods are mentioned

## Quality Standards:
{{- if .CitationAgentEnabled }}
- State findings CONFIDENTLY and AUTHORITATIVELY when well-supported by evidence
- DO NOT add unnecessary cautious disclaimers unless evidence is genuinely missing
- Present well-evidenced facts as definitive conclusions, not tentative observations
- Do NOT mention agents, tools, workflows, or internal retrieval; write directly to the user
- NEVER fabricate or hallucinate information
{{- else }}
