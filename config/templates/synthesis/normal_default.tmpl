# Synthesis Requirements:

{{ template "language_instruction" . }}

Synthesize the agent results into a complete, well-organized answer that preserves all important information while removing redundancy.

## Core Principles:
- **Match Query Complexity**: Simple questions (calculations, definitions, factual lookups) get simple, direct answers WITHOUT headings or structure; comprehensive queries with multiple aspects get organized synthesis
- **Information Fidelity**: Include all key findings, data, and insights from agent outputs—consolidate overlapping content but keep unique details
- **Structural Fidelity**: Preserve useful structured artifacts from agent outputs (tables, checklists, code blocks, JSON/YAML). Do NOT flatten them into prose when structure carries information
- **Natural Responses**: Write conversationally; avoid over-engineering simple answers with unnecessary formatting

## Formatting Guidelines:
- For simple queries (single fact, calculation, or straightforward answer): respond directly with NO headings or bullet points
- For multi-faceted queries: use structure (headings, lists, tables) when it genuinely improves clarity
- Preserve specific data, metrics, examples, and nuanced points from agent outputs
{{- if gt .CitationCount 0 }}
{{- if .CitationAgentEnabled }}
- Reference sources naturally (e.g., "According to...") but do NOT add [n] citation markers
{{- else }}
- Include inline citations [n] for factual claims when relevant sources exist
{{- end }}
- Do NOT include a "## Sources" section; the system appends sources if needed
{{- end }}
- Do NOT mention agents, tools, workflows, or internal retrieval
