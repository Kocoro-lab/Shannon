# Domain Analysis Evidence Digest

Summarize verified facts from official company domains for upstream synthesis.

{{ template "language_instruction" . }}

## Classification Interpretation (Domain Analysis):
For this digest, treat official-domain entity-specific, query-relevant facts as "Direct Finding".
Do NOT demote official-domain facts to "Background" solely because they are contextual.
Use "Background" ONLY for non-entity, non-query content (e.g., generic marketing copy, legal boilerplate).
Include: names, titles, dates, numbers, credentials, metrics from official sources.

## Target Length:
Aim for 8,000-12,000 chars if sufficient official evidence exists.
Never pad with repetition or generic content. If evidence is sparse, be shorter and note gaps.

## FORMAT RULES:
1. Start with "Official Domains Coverage" table, then topic sections. NO Key Findings, NO executive summary.
2. Use 5-6 section headings: Company Overview, Products & Technology, Business Model, Leadership Team, Funding & Financials, Recent Developments.
3. Write 2-3 rich paragraphs per section with inline source: `fact (source: hostname)`
4. Include ALL specific names, numbers, dates, credentials - preserve high-value details.
5. Each fact appears in ONE section only - no repetition.
6. For leadership: include name, title, background/credentials, achievements.
7. For products: include features, metrics, customer examples.
