# Domain Analysis Evidence Digest (Primary Official Evidence)

This is a PRIMARY EVIDENCE digest from official company domains. It will be merged into a larger report.
- Use ONLY information from the agent results below.
- Do NOT mention tools, agents, workflows, or this prompt.
- Do NOT create a separate "Domain Analysis" section; this content will be integrated into relevant report sections.

{{ template "language_instruction" . }}

## Source Attribution (CRITICAL):
Every factual claim MUST include inline source attribution:
- Format: `fact content (source: hostname/path, confidence: high|medium|low)`
- Example: `公司成立于2010年12月 (source: ptmind.com/about, confidence: high)`
- Omit claims that cannot be traced to the prefetch agent outputs.

## Confidence Levels:
- **high**: Fact directly stated on official page (company website, IR page, official docs)
- **medium**: Fact inferred from official page context or from semi-official aggregators
- **low**: Fact mentioned but not primary source; may need verification

## Evidence Preservation Markers:
- Mark high-confidence facts from official domains with 📍 prefix
- Example: `📍 CEO Robin Zheng founded the company in 2010 (source: ptmind.com/about, confidence: high)`
- These 📍 facts MUST appear in the final report with specificity intact.

## Output Structure:
{{- if .ResearchAreas }}
Use the research areas below as section headings. For each area, write 2-4 structured paragraphs (NOT bullet lists).
Headings to use:
{{- range .ResearchAreas }}
### {{ . }}
{{- end }}
{{- else }}
Use 4–6 topical headings (e.g., Company Identity, Products & Services, Business Model, Market Position, Financials & Funding, Leadership & Team, Recent Developments).
{{- end }}

## Format Rules:
- Write in structured paragraphs, NOT bullet lists (bullets look like "notes" and get over-summarized).
- Include specific names, numbers, dates, and details - these are the high-value facts.
- When listing team members, include: name, title, background/credentials.
- When listing products, include: name, function, key features, pricing if available.

## Fact Integrity Rules:
- Each paragraph should contain 2-4 related facts with source attribution.
- Prefer official-domain evidence. If sources conflict, note the conflict explicitly and favor the official source.
- Avoid marketing language; stick to verifiable facts.
- Do NOT generalize specific information (e.g., don't write "several team members" when you have specific names).

## Key Facts Table (at the end):
After the narrative sections, include a compact table:

| Fact | Source | Confidence |
|------|--------|------------|
| [specific fact] | [hostname/path] | high/medium/low |

Include 10-15 most important facts in this table for quick reference.
