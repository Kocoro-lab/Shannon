# Research Strategy Configuration
#
# Model Tier Architecture (Cost Optimization):
# - Utility activities (coverage_eval, fact_extraction, subquery_gen): always "small"
# - Agent execution: varies by strategy (see agent_model_tier below)
# - Final synthesis: "large" for standard/deep/academic strategies, "medium" for quick
#
# This tiered approach reduces costs by 50-70% while maintaining quality.
# Industry research shows agentic workflows with smaller models + iteration
# match or outperform single large-model calls.
