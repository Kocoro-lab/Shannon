# Shannon Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for Shannon. For the latest updates, check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Kocoro-lab/Shannon/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/Kocoro-lab/Shannon/discussions).

## v0.1 — Production Ready (Current)

- ✅ **Core platform stable** - Go orchestrator, Rust agent-core, Python LLM service
- ✅ **Deterministic replay debugging** - Export and replay any workflow execution
- ✅ **OPA policy enforcement** - Fine-grained security and governance rules
- ✅ **WebSocket streaming** - Real-time agent communication with event filtering and replay
- ✅ **SSE streaming** - Server-sent events for browser-native streaming
- ✅ **WASI sandbox** - Secure code execution environment with resource limits
- ✅ **Multi-agent orchestration** - DAG, parallel, sequential, hybrid, ReAct, Tree-of-Thoughts, Chain-of-Thought, Debate, Reflection patterns
- ✅ **Vector memory** - Qdrant-based semantic search and context retrieval
- ✅ **Hierarchical memory** - Recent + semantic retrieval with deduplication and compression
- ✅ **Near-duplicate detection** - 95% similarity threshold to prevent redundant storage
- ✅ **Token-aware context management** - Configurable windows (5-200 msgs), smart selection, sliding window compression
- ✅ **Circuit breaker patterns** - Automatic failure recovery and degradation
- ✅ **Multi-provider LLM support** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, and more
- ✅ **Token budget management** - Per-agent and per-task limits with validation
- ✅ **Session management** - Durable state with Redis/PostgreSQL persistence
- ✅ **Agent Coordination** - Direct agent-to-agent messaging, dynamic team formation, collaborative planning
- ✅ **MCP integration** - Model Context Protocol support for standardized tool interfaces
- ✅ **OpenAPI integration** - REST API tools with retry logic, circuit breaker, and ~70% API coverage
- ✅ **Provider abstraction layer** - Unified interface for adding new LLM providers with automatic fallback
- ✅ **Advanced Task Decomposition** - Recursive decomposition with ADaPT patterns, chain-of-thought planning, task template library
- ✅ **Composable workflows** - YAML-based workflow templates with declarative orchestration patterns
- ✅ **Unified Gateway & SDK** - REST API gateway, Python SDK (v0.2.0a1 on PyPI), CLI tool for easy adoption
- 🚧 **Ship Docker Images** - Pre-built docker release images, make setup straightforward

## v0.2 — Enhanced Capabilities

### SDKs & UI
- [ ] **TypeScript/JavaScript SDK** - npm package for Node.js and browser usage
- [ ] **(Optional) Drag and Drop UI** - AgentKit-like drag & drop UI to generate workflow yaml templates

### Built-in Tools Expansion
- [ ] **More tools** - more useful customized tools

### Platform Enhancements
- [ ] **Advanced Memory** - Episodic rollups, entity/temporal knowledge graphs, hybrid dense+sparse retrieval
- [ ] **Advanced Learning** - Pattern recognition from successful workflows, contextual bandits for agent selection
- [ ] **Agent Collaboration Foundation** - Agent roles/personas, agent-specific memory, supervisor hierarchies
- [ ] **MMR diversity reranking** - Implement actual MMR algorithm for diverse retrieval (config ready, 40% done)
- [ ] **Performance-based agent selection** - Epsilon-greedy routing using agent_executions metrics
- [ ] **Context streaming events** - Add 4 new event types (CONTEXT_BUILDING, MEMORY_RECALL, etc.)
- [ ] **Budget enforcement in supervisor** - Pre-spawn validation and circuit breakers for multi-agent cost control
- [ ] **Use case presets** - YAML-based presets for debugging/analysis modes with preset selection logic
- [ ] **Debate outcome persistence** - Store consensus decisions in Qdrant for learning
- [ ] **Shared workspace functions** - Agent artifact sharing (AppendToWorkspace/ListWorkspaceItems)
- [ ] **Intelligent Tool Selection** - Semantic tool result caching, agent experience learning, performance-based routing
- [ ] **Native RAG System** - Document chunking service, knowledge base integration, context injection with source attribution
- [ ] **Team-level quotas & policies** - Per-team budgets, model/tool allowlists via config

## v0.3 — Enterprise & Scale

- [ ] **Solana Integration** - Decentralized trust, on-chain attestation, and blockchain-based audit trails for agent actions
- [ ] **Production Observability** - Distributed tracing, custom Grafana dashboards, SLO monitoring
- [ ] **Enterprise Features** - SSO integration, multi-tenant isolation, approval workflows
- [ ] **Edge Deployment** - WASM execution in browser, offline-first capabilities
- [ ] **Autonomous Intelligence** - Self-organizing agent swarms, critic/reflection loops, group chat coordination
- [ ] **Cross-Organization Federation** - Secure agent communication across tenants, capability negotiation protocols
- [ ] **Regulatory & Compliance** - SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA automation with audit trails
- [ ] **AI Safety Frameworks** - Constitutional AI, alignment mechanisms, adversarial testing
- [ ] **Personalized Model Training** - Learn from each user's successful task patterns, fine-tune models on user-specific interactions
